      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Yoyo Munk is a scientist and artist based in Pittsburgh. A biologist by training, their background spans from insect flight aerodynamics and navigation behavior to the psychophysics of human visual responses to augmented reality displays. In their artistic practice, they explore the affordances of headset-based mixed reality as a medium, creating gallery-scale generative works designed to be explored by large audiences. They hold a PhD in Integrative Biology from UC Berkeley.</p>
